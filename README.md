# Message Board Built in Flask

A message dashboard that runs on the Flask microframework for Python

## To Run Locally
Note: I have included the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) file for the MySQL database schema as well as a .sql script to generate the required tables. Please generate a schema and start your database server before doing the following step.

```
# Install required packages with pip
pip install -r requirements.txt --allow-external mysql-connector-python
```
And finally:
```
# Start the server
python server.py
```

If you run into any problem, you could consult Flask documentation [here](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/installation/#installation).

Enjoy!
